# Overview

This repo introduces how to use the ReScreen as a USB-Host, which means you could plug USB devices into the ReScreen and play with it just like a computer!

This functionality is dependent on [USB Host Library SAMD](https://github.com/gdsports/USB_Host_Library_SAMD). The library has been tested with ReScreem(SAMD51) and working properly.

## Installing the USB Host Library SAMD

1. Visit the [USB Host Library SAMD](https://github.com/gdsports/USB_Host_Library_SAMD) repositories and download the entire repo to your local drive.

2. Now, the  library can be installed to the Arduino IDE. Open the Arduino IDE, and click `sketch` -> `Include Library` -> `Add .ZIP Library`, and choose the `Seeed_Arduino_LCD` file that you've have just downloaded.
